# Open access journals and preprint servers, suitable for filtering google
# scholar results.  Bear in mind that google scholar also links to full text on
# various institutional servers, so you may be better off testing against the
# paypers and paten URL groups.  Also consider "-url edu -o -url gov -o -url
# ac.uk" or "-type application/postscript -o -type application/pdf".
